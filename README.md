## 📌 Task Overview

**Objective**:  
Analyze road accident data to identify **high-risk locations**, **causes**, and **severity trends** to propose data-driven **safety improvements**.

This task involved cleaning, transforming, and visualizing accident-related data using **Power BI**, with optional use of **Python** or **SQL** for deeper analysis. The final output is an **interactive dashboard** designed to help stakeholders understand accident patterns and make informed decisions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI**  
  - Power Query (data transformation)  
  - DAX (data analysis expressions)  
  - Map visualizations (Geographic mapping)

- **Microsoft Excel**  
  - Data pre-cleaning and validation

- **SQL (optional)**  
  - Querying and filtering large datasets

- **Python (optional)**  
  - Predictive analytics using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

  - Year-wise and month-wise trends of accidents  
  - Time of day and day of week distribution

- **🚨 Severity Insights**  
  - Breakdown of minor, major, and fatal accidents  
  - Correlation between accident cause and severity

- **🔍 Root Cause Analysis**  
  Identification of major contributors: speeding, drunk driving, weather, vehicle failure, etc.

- **📅 Time-Based Filters**  
  Slicers for year, month, and time of day to explore specific accident patterns.

- **📌 Safety Recommendations Section**  
  Suggested preventive actions based on high-frequency causes and accident-prone zones.
